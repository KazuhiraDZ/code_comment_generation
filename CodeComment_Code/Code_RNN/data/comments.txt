 problem  it s opening night at the opera  and your friend is the prima donna  the lead female singer   you will not be in the audience  but you want to make sure she receives a standing ovation    with every audience member standing up and clapping their hands for her   initially  the entire audience is seated  everyone in the audience has a shyness level  an audience member with shyness level si will wait until at least si other audience members have already stood up to clap  and if so  she will immediately stand up and clap  if si   0  then the audience member will always stand up and clap immediately  regardless of what anyone else does  for example  an audience member with si   2 will be seated at the beginning  but will stand up to clap later after she sees at least two other people standing and clapping   you know the shyness level of everyone in the audience  and you are prepared to invite additional friends of the prima donna to be in the audience to ensure that everyone in the crowd stands up and claps in the end  each of these friends may have any shyness value that you wish  not necessarily the same  what is the minimum number of friends that you need to invite to guarantee a standing ovation  input  the first line of the input gives the number of test cases  t  t test cases follow  each consists of one line with smax  the maximum shyness level of the shyest person in the audience  followed by a string of smax   1 single digits  the kth digit of this string  counting starting from 0  represents how many people in the audience have shyness level k  for example  the string  409  would mean that there were four audience members with si   0 and nine audience members with si   2  and none with si   1 or any other value   note that there will initially always be between 0 and 9 people with each shyness level   the string will never end in a 0  note that this implies that there will always be at least one person in the audience   output  for each test case  output one line containing  case  x  y   where x is the test case number  starting from 1  and y is the minimum number of friends you must invite   limits  1     t     100  small dataset  0     smax     6   large dataset  0     smax     1000
